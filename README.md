#Overview

In the world of interconnected computers, servers, devices etc., Internet of Things(IoT)
comes with benefits as wells as challenges. Authentication and secure communication are
significant challenges to be tackled in growing adversarial environments. There have been
proposed many solutions by researchers around the world including traditional authentication
techniques such as password based, bio metrics, OAuth, cloud based authorization and

even blockchain based solutions. Fog computing is new networking paradigm which is a poten-
tial alternative to the currently used cloud services as they are deployed in close proximity to

the edge network and brings in new benefits and challenges altogether. Moreover, blockchain is
gaining prominence for its decentralized nature, high security measures and most particularly
its immutable nature.

Therefore we explore a solution of blockchain integrated with fog layer. Certain limita-
tions still exist regarding identification of devices, authentication, implementation, etc. during

communication. In this thesis, an improved architecture for device to device (D2D) secure com-
munication using fog nodes built on private ethereum platform has been described.

Keywords - Fog network, Edge computing, Blockchain, IoT, Ethereum, MQTT.
